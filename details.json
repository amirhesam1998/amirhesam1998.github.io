These skills help me create just the right solutions for the businesses I work with, especially when they need something reliable and scalable. I also believe in working together as a team and using Agile and Scrum methods to get things done better and faster.<br><br> I love tackling challenges, especially when it comes to organizing databases, making software run smoothly, and building systems that can grow with a company. I’m on the lookout for opportunities where I can put my Python , Php and Software development skills to good use and help create amazing tech that makes a difference."

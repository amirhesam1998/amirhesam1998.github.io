I started my journey with a degree in applied mathematics, but since I was very interested in technology and computer science, I was able to advance my career path towards the world of programming by using the degree and knowledge I gained from mathematics.

                My main tools are Python, Php. These skills help me create just the right solutions for the businesses I work with, especially when they need something reliable and scalable. I also believe in working together as a team and using Agile and Scrum methods to get things done better and faster.
                
                I love tackling challenges, especially when it comes to organizing databases, making software run smoothly, and building systems that can grow with a company. I’m on the lookout for opportunities where I can put my Python , Php and Software development skills to good use and help create amazing tech that makes a difference.
                
                Python, Php, Django, Laravel, REST APIs, SQL, NoSql, database design, design pattern, Docker, Linux, software engineering."
